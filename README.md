Designing a smart solution to water plants efficiently.
## Setup
Most of the setup is outlined in the Abstract and the Research Plan for the project. I decided to go with a Raspberry Pi for this prooject since it felt like a good option because of the lightweight nature and the builtin connectivity. The WaterPi folder contains scripts that run on the server and the web scripts that run for the webpage. You will need PHP and Nginx to use this. I would also recommend setting up a crontab job so that the scripts run on startup.
